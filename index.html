                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                Hello! I'm a Canadian native who recently made the move to the U.S. With 12 years of 
                experience in the oil and gas industry, I've developed a strong foundation in problem-solving 
                and technical expertise. I hold an associate degree in computer engineering and am currently 
                expanding my skill set by taking online courses in full-stack engineering
                </p>
                <p>
                I'm passionate about technology and eager to transition into the tech industry as a developer. 
                I'm excited to apply my engineering background to new challenges and opportunities in software development
                </p>
                <p>
                Outside of work, I enjoy exploring my creative side through photography, graphic design, and woodworking. 
                These hobbies allow me to express my artistic vision and bring a hands-on approach to my projects
                </p>
                <p>
                I'm always open to connecting with others in the industry, whether it's for collaboration, learning, or sharing ideas. Feel free to reach out!
                </p>
